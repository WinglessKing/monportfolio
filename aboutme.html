		My name is Adrey’n Lewis. I was born in Jacksonville, North Carolina on the military base called Campe Lejeune to one Marine father and a civilian mother. I spent the first two years of my life there before moving down to Georgia, which is why I tend to say I’m from Georgia rather than North Carolina. My early education started with a private christian school called Dunwoody Christian Academy, after which I followed the typical K-12 program that Dekalb County had set for us at the time.<br/> 
		My introduction to computer programming and the technology field overall started in high school. There I learned a bit of the basics of website building, such as HTML and CSS. With this, it sparked my interest in programming and I learned a bit of Python on my own at home. I made code that could turn whatever you type into a Caesar cypher and decrypt it as well. I still have the code I had written on a flashdrive to this day.<br />
		My full dive into the Information Technology field was the day I entered college. Kennesaw State University has a great program for Computer Programming and Information Technology. I learned Java and understood how to read other programming languages as well. It was a great reintroduction into the programming realm and I could not wish for anything better. I am now pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology with a focus on security.
