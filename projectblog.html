               <p>My First Project</p>
               <p>For an entire year, I watched approved RaspberryPi resellers hoping to find a kit in stock and go through with the project. This past May I was able to go through with the project after purchasing the CanaKit 4GB Extreme Kit. The kit included the board, case, an SD card reader, SD card preloaded with NOOBS(New Out Of Box Software), and 2 Micro HDMI cords. After a brief and simple assembly I plugged it into my monitor and started configuration.</p>

               <p>In the image above, I updated the software to its most recent release. I ended up mispelling one of the commands in my excitement.<p>

               <p>With everything configured, all that was needed was an ethernet connection and an SSD to function as the storage device and boom, it was finished and on my network.<p>

                <p>This was entertaining beyond belief. Whenever I struggle with a new project, be it code or hardware, it is much more satisfying to see it work well at the end.<p>
