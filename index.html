  	<p>This is the landing page for The Fye Place.<br> This website is for a school project and is meant to both practice web development and log my attempt at creating a portfolio for myself. The end goal is to fully display my skills in a computer science field and present myself as a viable candidate for whomever may be interested. <br> Click around and enjoy!</p>
